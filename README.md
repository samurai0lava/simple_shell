This project is a simple implementation of a Unix shell. It provides basic functionality such as executing commands, handling input/output redirection, and supporting pipelines. This shell is designed to run on Unix-like operating systems and supports the use of standard Unix commands.


Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:



Compilation
Your shell will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
